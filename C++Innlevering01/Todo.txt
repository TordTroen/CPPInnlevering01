### TODO
- Rect class to be used with collision (replace image rect?)
	- Functions that checks if a vector2D point is inside a rect
- Collider class
- PoolManager

### SDLWrapper
- Image and Text can be the same struct (or class so we can have resize, reposition functions and reconstructor for texture)
- Make DrawImage function actually check if something went wrong
